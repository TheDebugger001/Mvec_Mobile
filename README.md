# MVEC Admin Mobile (`Mvec_Mobile`)

Flutter super-admin console for the MVEC marketplace. Port of the web
`Mvec_frontend` admin, talking to `Mvec_backend`.

**Stack:** Flutter 3.29 / Dart 3.7 · Riverpod (state) · go_router (routing) ·
Dio (HTTP) · flutter_secure_storage (session)

---

## Quickstart

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run --dart-define=API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4000/api
```

Sign in with the seeded super-admin (from the backend `.env`):
`admin@gmail.com` / `admin!`. The screen shows a **Dev quick-login** button in
development builds.

> The backend must be running first. See `Mvec_backend/README.md` — the short
> version is `npm install && npm run setup && npm run dev`.

### Demo mode (no backend)

To present the app with nothing running locally, add `DEMO_MODE=true`:

```bash
flutter run --dart-define=DEMO_MODE=true
```

This opens the auth gate locally — **any** non-empty email and password is
accepted, and no network call is made. Use `admin@gmail.com` for the control
center, `supplier@mvec.rw` to sign in as a supplier, or another identity for
the marketplace home feed. Suppliers keep the marketplace as their initial
screen and open **Supplier account** from the existing account menu.

The marketplace and supplier workspace use local mock data, so both are
presentable without a backend. The supplier workspace includes product details
and image URLs, pricing, stock adjustments, order fulfillment, notifications,
and account preferences. Demo edits last for the current app session.

A supplier attaches a product photo by picking it **off the device** — gallery
or files — rather than pasting a link. The chosen file is copied into the app's
documents directory and referenced by path, which is why the photo lives as long
as the app is installed. It is *not* uploaded: there is no `POST /uploads/images`
route in `Mvec_backend` yet (the web app calls one that was never mounted), so
`media` stays out of the wholesale payload until that endpoint exists.

When demo mode is off, the supplier service uses these backend contracts:
`GET /supplier/products`, `GET /supplier/orders`,
`GET /supplier/notifications`, `GET /supplier/profile`, plus create/update
operations under those resources. Align or implement those authenticated
endpoints in the backend before switching the supplier role to live data. The
admin console still requires the backend and otherwise shows empty states.

The flag is **off by default**, so release builds always talk to the real
backend. Verify it with:

```bash
flutter test --dart-define=DEMO_MODE=true test/demo_mode_test.dart
```

> Note: the Linux desktop target additionally needs `libsecret-1-dev` on the
> host (pulled in by `flutter_secure_storage`). Web and Android need nothing
> extra.

### Useful commands

| Command                                     | Purpose                         |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `flutter run`                               | run on connected device/emulator|
| `flutter run --dart-define=API_BASE_URL=…`  | point at a different backend     |
| `flutter analyze`                           | lint — must be clean            |
| `flutter test`                              | run widget tests                 |
| `flutter build apk --debug`                 | Android build                    |

Environment overrides (all optional, via `--dart-define`):

- `API_BASE_URL` (default `http://localhost:4000/api`)
- `ADMIN_EMAIL` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD` (dev quick-login only)

> Emulator note: `localhost` is the device itself — use
> `http://10.0.2.2:4000/api` on the Android emulator or your machine's LAN IP
> on a real device.

## Project structure

```
lib/
  main.dart            app entry — MvecAdminApp
  core/                theme, utils, api_client, api_config, nav, router
  models/              plain data classes (user, party, catalog)
  services/            API wrappers (admin_service, platform_service)
  providers/           Riverpod providers (auth, admin)
  widgets/             shared UI kit (smart_table, charts, common, mv_icon)
  screens/
    layout/            admin_shell (drawer + topbar shell)
    auth/              login
    <module>/          one folder per admin page (one file each)
test/                  widget tests
```

**Every admin page is its own file under `lib/screens/<module>/`.** The 36
modules are wired in `lib/core/router.dart` (routes) and
`lib/core/nav_items.dart` (drawer groups).

---

## Team conventions (avoid merge conflicts)

1. **One module = one file.** Edit only the screen you own
   (e.g. `screens/orders/orders_screen.dart`). These almost never collide.

2. **Shared files are the only merge hotspots** — touch them only when adding a
   whole new page, and keep the diff to a couple of lines:
   - `core/router.dart` — add one import + one `GoRoute`
   - `core/nav_items.dart` — add one `NavItem`
   - `pubspec.yaml` — coordinate before adding deps

3. **Reuse the shared kit, don't rebuild it.** Widgets in `lib/widgets/`
   (`PageHead`, `MetricCard`, `DataCard`, `SmartTable`, `StatusChip`,
   `LoadingState`, …) already match the design system. If a page needs a new
   shared widget, add it to `widgets/` in your PR so others can reuse it.

4. **Server data flows through providers.** Add/extend a `FutureProvider` in
   `providers/admin_providers.dart` (or a module service) rather than calling
   Dio from inside a widget.

5. **Branching:** branch off `main` (`feat/<module>`), keep PRs small, rebase
   before pushing. Existing shared branches: `feature/home-screen`, `paccy`.

6. **Must pass before pushing:**
   ```bash
   flutter analyze && flutter test
   ```

## Backend endpoints used

Data comes from `Mvec_backend` (Express, base `/api`). Admin routes
(`/api/admin/*`) require a `super_admin` JWT from `POST /api/auth/login`.
`Mvec_backend/swagger.yaml` is outdated — the files in
`Mvec_backend/src/routes/` are the source of truth.
